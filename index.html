                  <h3>My Favorite Art Tools</h3>
                  <p>
                    Good Old Fashioned Mech Pencil <br>
                    Hi-Polymer Eraser <br>
                    Kneaded Eraser <br>
                    Ruler <hr>
                    My <span class="under">preference</span> isn't very strict. I try to do everything
                    with the most basic of supplies, for budget purposes.
                    I stick to mech pencils because they don't need <span class="under">sharpening</span> and
                    they are great for sketching. <br>

        <h3>My Artsitic Journey</h3>
        <a href="http://www.grandcircus.co"><img class="gif" src="http://gifyu.com/images/HB5E9E_0D1E61ECDD3AE_004.gif"></a>
        <p>
          I started out as a kid, drawing all the time on spare paper, particularly in class.
          There were tons of people who could really draw and I admired them; I even tried copying them.
          After a while I started to do some studying and picked up on some very useful tricks, though back then
          I still used standard pencil and lined paper. I made my way to the eight grade and drastically increased
          in skill compared to my usual work. In the spirit of that improvement I started my first comic
          (as competition for a comic my friend was popular for.) I was still very far from where I am now and didn't
          know how to make my art digital yet.
          <br>
          <br>
          Freshman year started and I met a girl in my chinese class named Melissa. She was brilliantly talented and
          drew almost effortlessly. No doubt, I admired Melissa's skils more than the skills of my mother, who I targeted
          my goals of surpassing. I asked her for help when I could and got lots of good tips and tricks. I changed my style
          a second time and my training began. I switched to copy paper and only used mechanical pencils. I started looking up
          tutorials and I even had a rival named Porfirio who I used to call "Nauno". After 9<sup>th</sup> grade year I stuck to my
          training and I improved well.
          <br>
          <br>
          I began using G.I.M.P. as a basic tool for my digital artwork. Digital art was an occasion for me, since I always found it
          terribly hard to pull off. I got an accout on deviantart after choosing my official artist tag; "Drahcir" (pronounced drah-sih-ur)
          which is my name spelled backwards and to add flair I added the roman numeral two to the end. I had everything I needed except a
          logo. I spent two hours trying to come up with one and finally I found it (I'm keeping the story behind it secret XD!). I started hanging
          out in the web design teacher's room at my high school and I began to learn how to use photoshop. My digital art began during my 11<sup>th</sup>
          grade year.
          <br>
          <br>
          Today, I hang out with other talented people at school as I perfect my drawing skills and become the best I can at what I do
          My signature tools are my Kuru Toga mech pencil and my Wacom Intuos Pen Drawing Tablet.
